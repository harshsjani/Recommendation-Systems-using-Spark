# Recommendation Systems

Created two recommendation systems: a content based recommendation system and a collaborative-filtering based recommendation system. These were created using Spark (both with PySpark as well as Scala). A subset of the Yelp academic subset was used for testing precision, recall and RMSE values.
The recommendation system achieved RMSE values of 0.85 for the collaborative-filtering based system and 0.96 for the content-based recommendation system.
